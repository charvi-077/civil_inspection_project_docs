Welcome to UVRSABI's Documentation!
===================================

The world in which we currently live is well equipped with a variety of conventional methods for analysing and assessing the geometry and state of civil structures. Buildings that don't conform to seismic structural requirements run the risk of imposing serious damages. The vulnerability of a building to earthquake can be assessed through inspection that takes into account the expected damage progression of the associated component and the componentâ€™s contribution to structural system performance.
Currently, buildings and other civil structures inspections are done manually in accordance with different set of norms. Such inspections may be expensive, risky, labor-intensive and resource-intensive, and time-consuming.
Hence, this project named, **UAV-based Visual Remote Sensing for Automated Building Inspection (UVRSABI)** proposes different methods that automate these inspections through UAV-based image data collection and a software
library for post-processing that helps in estimating structural parameters.


Check out the :doc:`Data Collection <dataCollection>` section for further information on how to collect the data, followed by
